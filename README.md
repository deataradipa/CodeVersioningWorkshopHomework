# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework
in this assignment, I learned how to create a new repository in github, the cloned it to my local.
Within my local, I did several changes and pushed some commits to the main branch. Also tried to revert a commit using git reset.
Command used: git clone, git init, git add, git commit, git push, git reset.

After that, I created two branches named experiment and feature, and did separate changes in each branch. When 
I tried to merge feature and experiment, I encountered a conflict. I used git diff to see the cause and edited the problematic file.
After that I was able to merge to experiment, and finally merge to main.

I also learned how to add collaborators to my repository.

In conclusion, this assignment is very helpful to refresh my understanding in git. Thank you CDE team for arranging the training.
